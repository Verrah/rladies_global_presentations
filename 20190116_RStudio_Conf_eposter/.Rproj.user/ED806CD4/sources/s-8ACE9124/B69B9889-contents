### **Who we are?**

**R-Ladies Leadership Team:** 
  <img src="img/leadership.png" alt="What will I see?" style="width:100%"></img>

**R-Ladies Global Team:** 
    
Laura Acion, Maelle Salmon, Bea Hernandez, Jennifer Thompson, Page Piccini, XXXX
**ADD PICTURES**


#### **WHO WE ARE**

**Dependencies**

This poster template dependes on the following R packages

- rmarkdown [@rmarkdown]
- flexdashboard [@flexdashboard]
- webshot [@webshot]

To use `scripts/generic-content.R` you will need a GNU/Linux system
and a working installation of `imagemagick`.


**Preparing your analysis environment**

In order to use this poster template, you need to:

1. Clone [`odeleongt/flexdashboard-poster`](https://github.com/odeleongt/flexdashboard-poster)
  from github
1. Install the required packages  
  `install.packages("rmarkdown", "flexdashboard", "webshot")`
1. Install the PhantomJS library  
  `webshot::install_phantomjs()`
1. Edit the template to fit your needs
1. Run `scripts/render-poster.R`


#### Hosting your poster

You can host the poster generated by this template in GitHub pages by
forking the repository, working on your local clone and
checking out the contents of the `output/` directory into the
root directory of the `gh-pages` branch:

```{}
## Finish commiting your updates ...

## Move to gh-pages
git checkout gh-pages

## Only checkout specific files
git checkout master output/*

## Copy files and clean up
cp -r output/* . && rm -R output/*
rmdir output && git reset HEAD

## Add contents, commit and publish
git add *
git commit -m 'Update published poster'
git push origin gh-pages
```


### **Results**

Here you would describe some amazing results.
Since this poster is about making a poster, I show the last poster.

**Fig. 1: Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror… shows many things…**
<img src="poster.png" alt="What will I see?" style="width:100%"></img>



```{r volcano-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
# Prepare a figure for later use
filled.contour(volcano)
```



#### Reproducible results with R

As we have come to expect, results from R computations can be included as well.
Since adjusting figure positions will be almost always necesary,
figures are by default saved to `output/img/` and not shown on the poster.
You need to manually include them using a <img> tag as shown below.

```html
**Fig. 1: Place the volcano figure where you please.**
<img src="img/volcano-plot-1.png" style="width:100%"></img>
```


#### Output for printing

A png file is produced by `scripts/render-poster.R`.
By default it is set to use a 300ppi resolution and A1 size.
For now, some testing is necessary to adjust scale and poster size.


### **Discussion**


```{r new-standard}
# # Get reference image
# download.file(
#   "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png", mode = "wb",
#   destfile = "../output/img/standards.png"
# )
```


Since there are so many tools that can be used to prepare posters,
and not a single one satisfies my needs,
I prepared this *other* tool to... nah it still is missing things.

**Fig. 3: Some authoritative content**
<img src="img/standards.png" style="width:100%"></img>


#### Limitations

Since the png file is generated as a snapshot of the html poster,
several limitations should be considered:

- Resolution is very limited by the resources in your system
- Larger formats require much more resources to render
- Complex posters can take longer to load, so you have to try different delays
- The preview shown in `poster/poster_frame.html` could be very different to
the final rendered image
- "I can't fit enough text/figures!"  
  ↑ that one's on you, nobody likes a crammed poster
